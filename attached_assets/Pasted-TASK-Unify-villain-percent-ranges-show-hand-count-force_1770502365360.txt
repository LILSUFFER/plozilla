TASK: Unify villain percent ranges + show hand count + force VPS compute using the latest rank file

We must remove all ambiguity between “Top 10%” and “10%”.
From now on, the ONLY supported percent-range input format is:

  N%   (examples: 1%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 100%)

We will NOT support "topN%", "Top 10", etc. Remove those labels entirely from UI.

IMPORTANT: All equity and breakdown computations must use the latest rank file produced on the VPS (the 9-hour precompute). Replit must only proxy to VPS; no heavy compute on Replit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Range format rules (backend + frontend)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A) Villain input parsing must accept:
- "100%" (full range)
- "N%" where N is a number (integer or decimal), 0 < N <= 100

Reject any "topN%" strings. If they appear, treat it as an error and instruct user to use "N%".

B) Normalize internally:
- If villain is "10%" => rangePercent = 10
- If villain is "100%" => full range (no restriction)

No separate “Top 10%” concept exists anymore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Show number of hands/combos for N% (like PPT does)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We must display how many hands/combos are included for the chosen percent.

We are using the FULL 5-card PLO combo universe:
  TOTAL_COMBOS = 2,598,960

So:
  combosCount = round(TOTAL_COMBOS * (N / 100))

Examples:
- 10% => 259,896 combos
- 1%  => 25,990 combos (rounded)
- 20% => 519,792 combos

UI requirement:
- When villain is "N%", show a badge/label next to Player 2:
  “{combosCount} combos”
- This must appear exactly like in PPT (screenshot reference).

Also ensure the same count is used everywhere (equity results header, breakdown panel, etc).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Always use the latest VPS rank file
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We have a fresh rank file computed on VPS (9 hours). This file must be used for ALL percent-range sampling.

Backend requirements:
- Add env var RANK_FILE_PATH, default to:
  public/plo5_rankings_prod.bin  (or the exact latest file name we deploy)
- When villain is "N%" (N < 100):
  - Pass --villain-range "{N}%"
  - Pass --rank-file "${RANK_FILE_PATH}"
  - Rust must sample villain hands ONLY from the top N% of the FULL 2,598,960 universe
  - Blockers must be applied (villain cannot overlap hero/board).

If rank file missing => reject request with a clear error:
  "Rank file not found on engine server. Percent ranges require the latest rank file."

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Force ALL compute to run on VPS (no local compute)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We want production behavior:
- Equity and EQ Breakdown must run on VPS only.

Backend:
- If EQUITY_ENGINE_URL is set, ALWAYS forward requests to VPS.
- Add a hard guard:
  If process.env.FORCE_REMOTE_EQUITY === "true" and EQUITY_ENGINE_URL is not set -> return error and do NOT spawn local binary.

Frontend:
- Show badge at top: “Engine: VPS” if remote mode is active.
- Never silently fall back to local compute when FORCE_REMOTE_EQUITY=true.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5) UI cleanup
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove all “Top 1% / Top 3% / Top 5% / Top 10% / Top 20%” buttons and any “topN%” labels.

Instead, provide quick buttons that fill Player 2 with:
  100%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 3%, 1%

But the value inserted is exactly "10%", not "top10%".

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Acceptance criteria
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) There is no difference between “Top 10” and “10%” because “Top 10” no longer exists. Only "10%" exists.
2) When Player 2 = "10%", UI shows "259,896 combos" (based on TOTAL_COMBOS=2,598,960).
3) Percent ranges always use the latest VPS rank file; no canonical-hand shortcut.
4) All equity and breakdown computations run on VPS when FORCE_REMOTE_EQUITY=true.
5) Results match PPT-style behavior within Monte Carlo error.

Implement these changes end-to-end (UI + server + engine call flags).
