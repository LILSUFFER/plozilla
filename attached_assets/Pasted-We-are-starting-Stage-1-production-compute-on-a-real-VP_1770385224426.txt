We are starting Stage-1 production compute on a real VPS.

Goal:
Get HIGH-QUALITY rankings in ~3–5 hours runtime,
with expected max equity error ≈ 0.15% vs high-precision Monte Carlo.
This is NOT the final ultra-precision run — just the first production baseline.

Your task is to prepare a ONE-COMMAND VPS workflow.

REQUIREMENTS

1) Do NOT change the algorithm anymore.
   The Rust engine, sampling model, and PLO5 evaluation are considered FINAL for Stage-1.

2) Production parameters must be:

   BOARDS = 10000
   VILLAIN_SAMPLES = 10
   THREADS = auto (use all CPU cores)

   These values must be configurable via environment variables,
   but default to the numbers above.

3) Provide two bash scripts:

   scripts/vps_setup.sh
   scripts/vps_run_stage1.sh

   vps_setup.sh must:
   - use: set -euo pipefail
   - install system deps (build-essential, git, curl, pkg-config, libssl-dev)
   - install Rust non-interactively
   - print rustc and cargo versions

   vps_run_stage1.sh must:
   - use: set -euo pipefail
   - build Rust release binary
   - run precompute with Stage-1 parameters
   - write output to:
       public/plo5_rankings_stage1.bin
   - verify file exists and is non-empty
   - print HARD COUNTERS:
       heroes_processed
       boards_per_hero
       villain_samples_per_board
       total_showdowns
       elapsed_seconds
       showdowns_per_second

4) Accuracy sanity check (fast):

   After Stage-1 compute,
   run built-in accuracy command on TWO benchmark hands:

   - JsTh5dTc4c  (PPT ≈ 53.89)
   - AcAhTh8d7c  (PPT ≈ 65.85)

   using:
   trials = 2,000,000

   Print:
   engine_equity
   mc_equity
   absolute_delta

   Do NOT fail the script on delta > 0.15%,
   just print the numbers clearly.

5) Provide exact VPS copy-paste instructions:

   Only these commands:

   unzip project.zip
   cd project
   bash scripts/vps_setup.sh
   bash scripts/vps_run_stage1.sh

   Nothing more.

6) Do NOT discuss theory.
   Output ONLY:
   - the two scripts
   - the minimal instructions
   - no extra commentary.
