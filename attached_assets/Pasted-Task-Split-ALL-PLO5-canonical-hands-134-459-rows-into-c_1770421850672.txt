Task: Split ALL PLO5 canonical hands (134,459 rows) into category buckets and add a category picker on the Hand Rankings page.
Do NOT use percentages. Just categories → filter table.

Scope:
- Client-side classification only (v1). No backend changes required.
- Classification must run once after the rankings list loads, store result per hand_key, and allow instant filtering.

UI:
1) Add a left sidebar (or dropdown on mobile) called "Categories".
2) Show a simple expandable tree:
   - All hands
   - Unpaired
     - Double-suited (DS)
       - 5-card rundown (0–2 gaps)
       - 4-card rundown (0–2 gaps)
       - 3 Broadway
       - 2 Broadway + 3 low
       - Ragged
     - Single-suited (SS)
       - same subcategories
   - One Pair
     - DS
     - SS
   - Two Pair
     - DS
     - SS
   - Trips (optional)
3) Clicking a node filters the table to hands in that bucket.
4) Filtering must NOT affect global rank values; rank stays from API.

Classification rules (must implement):
A) Pair type by rank multiplicities:
- Unpaired: 5 distinct ranks
- One Pair: 2+1+1+1
- Two Pair: 2+2+1
- Trips: 3+1+1
(Anything else → "Other", can be hidden)

B) Suited type by suit counts in the 5-card hand:
- Double Suited (DS): suit counts are 2+2+1
- Single Suited (SS): suit counts are 2+1+1+1
- Otherwise → "Other suitedness" (can be hidden in v1)

C) Unpaired subcategories (evaluate only if Unpaired):
- Determine best “rundown” found in the 5 ranks:
  - 5-card rundown (0–2 gaps): the 5 ranks form a 5-long straight window with <=2 gaps
  - else 4-card rundown (0–2 gaps): any 4-rank subset forms a 4-long straight window with <=2 gaps
  - else 3 Broadway: at least 3 ranks in {A,K,Q,J,T}
  - else 2 Broadway + 3 low: exactly 2 ranks in {A,K,Q,J,T} and 3 ranks <=9
  - else Ragged
Gap definition for a rank set of size k:
gaps = (maxRank - minRank + 1) - k
Use A both as 14 and as 1 to detect wheel structures; choose min gaps.

Performance requirements:
- Do not re-classify on every render. Compute once and store in Map<hand_key, category>.
- Filtering uses the stored category map.
- Must stay fast with 134,459 rows.

Deliver:
- Implement classifyHand(hand) utility
- Integrate sidebar filtering
- Provide screenshots: All hands, Unpaired→DS→5-card rundown, One Pair→SS
