We need equity to match ProPokerTools for “Hero PLO5 hand vs 100% random range”.
Definition must be EXACT:
- Hero is fixed (5 cards).
- Board is sampled/enumerated from remaining 47 cards (excluding hero).
- Villain 5-card hand is sampled from remaining 42 cards (excluding hero and board).
No overlap with hero is allowed.

PROBLEM:
Your quasi-exact script builds the villain histogram from the 47-card pool and DOES NOT exclude hero cards
(you even mention "~0.3% bias"). This causes systematic equity errors, e.g. JsTh5dTc4c:
PPT = 53.89%, ours = 54.7%.

TASKS:

1) Add a validation CLI:
   scripts/check_equity_vs_random.ts
   Input: 5-card hero hand string (e.g. "Js Th 5d Tc 4c")
   Output: equity vs random with TWO modes:
   (A) unbiased Monte Carlo: sample board from remaining 47, villain from remaining 42 (no overlaps)
   (B) current quasi-exact method
   Print both values and their delta.

2) Fix the quasi-exact pipeline so the stored equity corresponds to the unbiased definition:
   IMPORTANT: a single per-board villain histogram from 47 cards is NOT enough because villain distribution depends on excluding the specific hero cards.

   So choose ONE correct approach and implement it:

   Option 1 (recommended, correct & feasible):
   Keep board enumeration exact (or sampled), but for each hero compute villain equity via Monte Carlo that samples villain from the remaining 42 cards (excluding hero+board), using CRN seeds per board for variance reduction.
   This removes bias and can be adaptive (more samples only where needed).

   Option 2 (harder):
   Build additional data structures per board that allow excluding an arbitrary 5-card set from villain hand enumeration exactly.
   (If you can’t do this efficiently, don’t pretend it’s exact.)

3) Add acceptance check:
   For these test hands, our equity must match PPT within <=0.15% after enough samples:
   - JsTh5dTc4c should be ~53.89% vs random
   (add 3-5 more test hands I will provide if needed)

4) After fix, regenerate rankings file and confirm all 134,459 hands load.
