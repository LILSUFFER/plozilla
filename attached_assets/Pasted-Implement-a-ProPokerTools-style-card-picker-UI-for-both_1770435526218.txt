Implement a ProPokerTools-style card picker UI for both Board and Player hands (PLO5).

GOAL
Users must be able to select cards by clicking a 52-card grid (like PPT), not only by typing text.
Typing must still work; picker and text input must stay in sync.

SCOPE
1) Board card picker:
- Board has 0..5 cards (preflop/flop/turn/river).
- Next empty board slot is “active”. Clicking a card fills the active slot.
- Clicking an already-filled board card removes it.
- Show the 5 board slots as small card chips; each slot clickable.
- Provide a “Clear board” button.

2) Player hand picker (PLO5):
- Each player has up to 5 hole cards (hero is 5 cards; ranges are also allowed).
- If the player input is a specific hand (5 cards), show 5 slots like board.
- Clicking fills next empty hand slot. Clicking a filled slot removes that card.
- If the player input is a range string (e.g., "top10%" or "AA,KK+"), do NOT show hand slots; show the text input as today.

3) Shared deck / blockers:
- A card selected on board or any player becomes unavailable (disabled) everywhere else.
- Disabled cards must appear greyed out and not clickable.
- If user removes a card, it becomes available again.
- Prevent duplicates and overlaps at UI level.

4) Modal / Popover picker:
- Clicking on the board area or a “Pick cards” icon opens a modal (or popover) with a 52-card grid.
- Grid layout: 4 suit rows (♠ ♥ ♦ ♣) and 13 ranks (A K Q J T 9 ... 2) similar to PPT.
- Each card cell shows rank + suit color, and is clickable.
- Modal has: Clear, OK, Cancel.
  - OK applies changes.
  - Cancel discards changes.
- Optional: allow selecting directly without OK (live apply), but still keep a Cancel option if possible.

5) Sync with text inputs:
- Board text input must update when cards are chosen (e.g., "AsKd3c").
- If user types in the board input, the picker must reflect it (parse + normalize).
- Same for player hand inputs.
- Support shorthand board like "333" => auto-normalize to "3h3d3c" (from previous fix).

6) UX details:
- Add small “grid” button next to Board and each Player that opens the picker.
- Add keyboard support: Backspace removes last selected card in the active area.
- On desktop: modal centered; on mobile: bottom sheet.

TECH
- Add a reusable <CardPickerModal> component.
- Add a shared card parsing/formatting helper (client side) so the UI always displays canonical card strings.
- Do NOT change equity math or API; this is UI-only + parsing/normalization.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS
- User can build board by clicking 5 cards; text input shows correct string; no overlaps allowed.
- User can build hero 5-card hand by clicking; cards disabled if already on board.
- Switching between typing and clicking stays consistent.
- Range input like "top10%" keeps text mode (no card slots/picker for that player).
