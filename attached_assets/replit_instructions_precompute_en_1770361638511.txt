COPY/PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT (IN ENGLISH) — YOU MUST IMPLEMENT IT EXACTLY

I NEED A READY OFFLINE PRECOMPUTE SCRIPT IN THIS PROJECT (Node/TypeScript) THAT GENERATES A STATIC RANKINGS FILE.
DO NOT DO ANY EQUITY CALCULATIONS AT RUNTIME.

1) Add this file to the repo:
   scripts/precompute_canonical_rankings_v4.ts
   (Use the code provided below as-is.)

2) Add an npm script in package.json:
   "precompute:rankings": "tsx scripts/precompute_canonical_rankings_v4.ts"

3) Running:
   npm run precompute:rankings
   must output:
   public/plo5_rankings_v4.json.gz

4) After that, refactor runtime so it NEVER seeds/calculates:
   - Remove any automatic calls to seedRankingsInProcess() in server/routes.ts.
   - If rankings file is missing, return a clear error and do NOT compute.
   - Implement /api/rankings to read ONLY from the precomputed file.

5) Acceptance tests:
   - If public/plo5_rankings_v4.json.gz is missing, /api/rankings MUST error, not seed.
   - There must be ZERO calls to calculateVsRandom/simulate in runtime.
