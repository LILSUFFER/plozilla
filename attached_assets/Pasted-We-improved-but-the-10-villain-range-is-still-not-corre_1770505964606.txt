We improved, but the “10%” villain range is still not correct enough.
Current deltas:

AhAdThTd9s vs 10%: 64.74% (PPT ~64.30)  Δ≈ +0.44
Jh9h8h7h5s vs 10%: 40.13% (PPT ~40.77)  Δ≈ -0.64

This is still too large for 600k trials unless the villain range definition/sampling differs from PPT.

IMPORTANT: The recent fixes (dead cards, ceil->floor, sanity check) are good, but they do NOT prove that “N%” is sampled uniformly over the topK of ALL 2,598,960 concrete combos.

TASK: Prove and enforce that villain sampling for “N%” is combo-uniform over the topK list.

1) Verify sampling basis (must be combos, not canonical classes):
   - Add a diagnostic mode: --debug-range N%
   - In this mode, run 1,000,000 villain draws (no hand eval needed), only sampling from the N% pool with blockers disabled.
   - Count occurrences by:
     a) concrete-hand index position bucket (e.g., 100 buckets across [0..topK-1])
     b) canonical-class id (suit-isomorphic key)
   - Expected:
     - bucket histogram should be ~uniform (±0.5% per bucket for 1e6 samples)
     - canonical-class frequencies should be proportional to their combo multiplicity inside topK, NOT uniform per class

2) If sampling is not combo-uniform, fix it:
   - The only correct approach is:
     - pick random integer r in [0..topK-1]
     - decode concrete villain hand from ranked_concrete[r]
     - reject if overlaps excluded_bm (hero+board+dead)
     - repeat
   - Ensure ranked_concrete is a length 2,598,960 array of concrete hands sorted by equity derived from the production canonical binary (no MC).

3) Remove any remaining “canonical-weighted” shortcuts:
   - Do NOT sample canonical hands and then expand to suits.
   - Do NOT sample canonical keys uniformly.
   - Do NOT sample from “top canonical hands”.
   All of these are biased vs PPT’s “10% = 259,896 hands”.

4) Increase correctness checks:
   - Add a startup print (or /api/equity/status field) that confirms:
     - rank_index mode = "concrete_combo_uniform"
     - totalConcrete = 2,598,960
     - topK for 10% = 259,896 exactly
   - Add an assertion: when N%=10, the displayed “combos” must equal 259,896 always.

5) Regression tests:
   - Run 2,000,000 trials (MC) with seed=12345 for:
     - AhAdThTd9s vs 10%
     - Jh9h8h7h5s vs 10%
   - Target: |delta| <= 0.25% vs PPT reference (or vs a high-trial internal baseline).
   If still larger, the range sampling is still wrong.

Deliverables:
- debug-range diagnostic output (histograms)
- sampling implementation confirmed combo-uniform
- updated /api/equity/status with rank index mode + topK info
- updated regression tests passing
